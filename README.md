# Predicting-Walmart-Sales-by-Time-Series-Analysis-Python
The project focuses on predicting Walmarts sales based on various variables such as store size, weekly sales, number of transactions in a day, temperature etc. Our approach to this problem includes data cleaning, visualisation and prediction based of time-series predictive models such as ARIMA, SARIMA followed by the implementation of Facebook-Prophet.
The purpose of this project is to model the future sales of Walmart using the historical sales data at Walmart and other dependent variables contributing to sales including high sales season during holidays. This enables Walmart to focus on inventory and staffing solutions during the holiday season. The project uses time series to develop the models and fit the models using test data and identify the best model for future use. We used SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive integrated moving average) without dependent variables, SARIMA with dependent variables and FB Prophet and calculated the MSE of all 3 models
